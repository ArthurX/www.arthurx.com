<h1><center>ArthurX in Aalen Open Art, <br>Stuttgart, Germany, <br>Jule 2003 </h1>

10 Painters from all over Europe were invited.<br>
The curator was Christine Bergam.<br>
The location is in the south of Germany close to Stuttgart.<br>
5 Days.<br>
Rain and sunshine.<br>
Each day a new painting.<br>
High rising mountains in the background.<br>
<br>
The press had a concise review of ArthurX. <br><br> 

"Hollands ArthurX genügen wenige schwungvolle Pinselstriche <br>
um vor allem die Damenwelt in seinen Bildern zu verewigen." <br>
Swäbische Post, 8 Juli 2003. <br>
<br>
"A few momentumful brush lines suffice  for Holland's ArthurX <br> 
to perpetuate above all the lady world in his pictures."<br> <br>

<br>In Aalen they organize an open air painting party. <br>
So in the center of town we all got painting.<br>
Because of the rain we took cover under the parasols of an biergarten.<br><br>




<img src="Paintings/Aalen_Kristina/Art_scetches_Kristina_720.jpg" width="720" height="1069" alt="" border="0">
<br>At the opening ceremony I discovered Kristina the older sister of Ronald.<br>
So after one day painting the buildings, what is not  my style,<br>
I asked the special teacher and caretaker of Ronald to bring Ronalds'sister.<br><br>
We met in Cafe Danneman, where Ronald went to paint himself every afternoon.<br>
I started to make sketches of Kristina.<br><br>
Ronald (in the wheelchair) and his painting friend (in the green shirt) soon discovered,<br>
that I could not paint at all.<br>
"Nur Kritzen Kratze!"<br>

<br>Here I'm working in the Biergarten again.<br>
"Kristina Smiles as the Devil Turns."<br>
The week after  all the painting was finished, had a wonderful weather.<br>
<br>
We went biking.<br>
In the hills around Aalen to Nordlingen.<br>
And later down the Donau valley from Passau (Germany) to Vienna.<br><br>

<br>A scetch of Kristina standing in front of me.<br>
All scetches together took about half an hour. <br>
<br>
On our way to Aalen we stepped out of the train.<br>
It was the begin of the Lorelei valley, the road to the gorges of the Rhine.<br>
We biked along side the river with cliffs, steep forests, sharp turns and small towns.<br>
In one of those towns was a church.<br>
So I went in, became absorbed with rest and lighted two candles.<br><br>
I'm not religious or superstitious,<br>
but in a church there's not much else to do.<br>
You need to light two candles.<br><br>
One for my mother.<br>
One for my old-uncle Gerrit.<br><br>
One for the beautiful girls I have met.<br>
One for the girls I will meet.<br>
<br>
And God was gracious to me like never before.<br><br>

<br>The exhibition was through out the center of town in small shops like this lady boutique.<br>
Kristina couldn't help laughing at so much fuss about her.<br>
Almost embarassing.<br><br>

<br>All photo's were printed afterwards.<br>
So I didn't cheat and watch the photo and make a copy of it in paint.<br><br>

<img src="Paintings/Aalen_Kristina/Scetch_Kristina_Face_720.jpg" width="720" height="1117" alt="" border="0">

<br> We were an army of painters.<br>
Powerful and yellow.<br>
Dressed to kill any illusion.<br><br>


<img src="Paintings/Aalen_Kristina/Katherina_Close_720.jpg" width="720" height="1046" alt="" border="0">
<br> This is Katherina.<br>
She was tuesday in Cafe Danneman.<br>
She is the girlfriend of the teacher of Ronald.<br><br>
While I made the sketches, she wondered:<br>
"Why's that dope watching me all the time?"<br><br>

<br>Exhibition in the Schaposhop.<br>

but instant inspiration.<br><br>

<br> "Katherina Dance!" <br>

<br>This was the first day: so painting the buildings.<br><br>

<img src="Paintings/Aalen_Kristina/OPENARTAALEN_0025_GhostHouse_Contrast_720.jpg" width="720" height="544" alt="" border="0">
<br>This is not really a building that is there.<br>
But could we make something like that with the same traditional wooden beam structure.<br>
New architecture with the same old  living and varied materials.<br>




<img src="Paintings/Aalen_Kristina/OpenArtAalen_0055_Contrast_Aalen_Birds_Eye_720.jpg" width="720" height="494" alt="" border="0">
<br>A view from above the town.<br>
A pattern of organically grown streets,<br>
With unique houses piece by piece.<br>
Every building, every window has its own soul.<br><br>
No copies of copies of copies like in modern architecture and townplanning.<br><br>
I was standing in the newly build, high rise, discustingly ugly town hall.<br><br>

<img src="Paintings/Aalen_Kristina/OpenArtAalen_0088_Contrast_Chris_Bergam_720.jpg" width="720" height="1021" alt="" border="0">
<br>The curator: Christine Bergam with, well what should it be, a grandchild.<br>
She organized it so well.<br>
Should get an award for it.<br><br>

<br>We met an American photographer and artist,<a href=http://www.artnsound.de/kunst_archiv/GALL01/paris_skizzen/paris_skizzen_piet_keitel.htm> Piet Keitel</a> , 
who got back to his ancestors in Aalen.<br>
He makes simply great photographs.<br>
It sounds easy, it is easy, but most people can't.<br>
Knows
 the best pizza in town.<br>
 And makes wild scetches of cityscapes, like Paris.<br><br>
 One day I will tour with a big band and he will make the great pictures.<br><br>


<img src="Paintings/Aalen_Kristina/OpenArtAalen_0024_Contrast_Spy_Tower_720.jpg" width="720" height="923" alt="" border="0">
<br>The townhall had a small tower.<br>
According to the local lore Napoleon had slept there.
<br>"Napoleon's night in Aalen."
