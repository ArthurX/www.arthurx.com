<H1><br>We want More</h1>
<pre>
... . We want more.     
... . We want more.    
... . We want more juice all around.      
      We want more juice all around.   

In your mouth, dripping of your lips.
In your ears, hanging on that rings.
At your arms, in your pits.
In the words slipping of your tongue.
 
... . We want more.     
... . We want more.    
... . We want more juice all around.      
      We want more juice all around.   

In your neck dropping onto your back      
In your brain sticking at all cells.
At your nerves traceing all those naps.
In your thaughts waggling your heights.

... . We want more.     
... . We want more.    
... . We want more juice all around.      
      We want more juice all around.
