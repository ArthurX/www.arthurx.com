<H1><br>Late At Night</h1>
<pre>
And it's late at night,
    And it's late at night,
        And it's late at night,
    And the river is running down,
And the tide is pulling back.

And I'm walking along the bay,
And the lights twinkle in the black waters.

And it's late at night,
    And it's late at night,
        And it's late at night,
    And the river is running down,
And the tide is pulling back.

Leaving it's treasures in the slick,
Make the fish drowing on the sand,
Sending the crabs to their final flesh,
Ask the seagulls to stalk a meal.

And it's late at night,
    And it's late at night,
        And it's late at night,
    And the river is running down,
And the tide is pulling back.

And I pass under the trees,
And the leaves rustle in the breeze.
And I keep a daisy in my hands.

And I tear it apart.
    And I tear it apart.
        And I tear it apart.
And it is breaking me up that night,
    And it is breaking me up that night.
        And it is breaking me up that night.
For I'm thinking of you,
     For I'm thinking of you,
          For I'm thinking of you,
That bloody long night.

And it's late at night,
    And it's late at night,
        And it's late at night,
    And the river is running up,
And the tide is pushing in.

And a purple day sets up,
And the haze lifts of the meadows.

And I tear it apart.
    And I tear it apart.
        And I tear it apart.
And it is breaking me up that night,
    And it is breaking me up that night.
        And it is breaking me up that night.
For I'm thinking of you,
     For I'm thinking of you,
          For I'm thinking of you,
That bloody long night.

And it's late at night,
    And it's late at night,
        And it's late at night,
    And the river is running down,
And the tide is pulling back.

And the sun climbs into the sky,
And the tourists flock the beaches.

And it's late at night,
    And it's late at night,
        And it's late at night,
    And the river is running down,
And the tide is pulling back.

And the kids build their fancy castles,
To be cleared by the sea.
And the girls splash in the water,
Creating perls flying all around.

And it's late at night,
    And it's late at night,
        And it's late at night,
    And the river is running up,
And the tide is pushing in.

And  the campfires are all set alight,
And the guitar plays his tune.   

And it's late at night,
    And it's late at night,
        And it's late at night,
    And the river is running down,
And the tide is pulling back.

And I tear it apart.
    And I tear it apart.
        And I tear it apart.
And it is breaking me up that night,
    And it is breaking me up that night.
        And it is breaking me up that night.
For I'm thinking of you,
     For I'm thinking of you,
          For I'm thinking of you,
That bloody long night.
