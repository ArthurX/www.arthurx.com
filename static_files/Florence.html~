<h1><center><br>ArthurX at Bienale di Firenze, Dec 2003.</h1>





<img src="Paintings/Biennale_Florence_photos/Frames_720.jpg" width="720" height="578" alt="" border="0">

<br>Arthurx' paintings in a double frame: Museum Woman and Italian Girl.<br>

The frame consists of wooden beams,<br>

connected at the corners with big bolts and nuts.<br>

The painting is attached to it by a rubber elastic cord.<br><br>

There is of course a risk to this way of framing the paintings:<br>

People only watch  the frame.<br>

But every trick and gimmick is aloud to get attention at such an event.<br>

And I make the paintings in the same way in my studio.<br>

I didn't invent it for exhibits.<br>

It's just the easiest way to connect a canvas to a frame.

<p>

It worked out well. <br>

There were even a few girls,

<br>who wanted to be photographed together with the paintings.<br>

What more can you want.<br>

<p>

I just was to shy to step forward

and say: <br>"Hi, I am the artist. Shall we pose together?"<br><br>

<br><a href=http://www.nwlaartgallery.com>Michael Moore</a> and Arthurx before the spiraling self portraits.<br>

Some how Elizabeth got the impression that the juror,<br>

who invited him was the same as the one who invited me.<br>

Because his works looks wild and modern impressionist styled.<br>

Maybe he could fit in with the Nouveau Fauvisme art stream.<br><br>

<br> Sam, ArthurX and the American artist Michael Moore taking a break from the networking.<br>

Smiling at command is a special skill.<br>

Especially when it needs to look naturally.<br><br>

<br>One of the last days Doc Antoine told us it was a nice weather to make a shot of the entrance.<br>

So we did. <br><br>

<br>Our hotel room had a view as big as a ballroom.<br><br>

<br> Sit-ins were very popular. 

<br>Here with 

<a href=http://www.artforafterhours.com/1002_ME.html>Mikel Elam</a>

an artist from Philladelphia, always good fun, <br>

especially with his non-Barbie-Doll friends form LA.

<br> His works made me think of Bob Marley.

<br> The mood, the battle and attitude.

<br>This was at one of the first days so still a bit stressed.
