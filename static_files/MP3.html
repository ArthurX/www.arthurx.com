The Last Thing I Will Do with This Live

</a><td>10Min

<td bgcolor=red>

<p>This song I have written so long ago, that I gave up the idea of ever playing it and singing along.

<p>But now somehow I'm starting to be able to play piano along with singing. I play piano for years now, usually

a kind of classical sounding inprovisation.

<p>And I hoped  one day to be able to perform it.

You meet a girl and she is too pretty.<br>

You try everything and yes for a very short period of time you succeed.<br>

You know  to please her.<p>

Pretty birds fly too fast.

<br>So our bass player lost out.</td></tr>

Remembering his fallen love,<br>

who is wildly ripped out of his life.

<td bgcolor=#1efeca>This is also an old song.

<p>It's at the moment when you get a present of your mother for your master degree. And your are falling out of an plane.

<p>Yes, you got an one-week-course for para-jumping.

<td bgcolor=#faf900>This is a guitar Jam of 25 October 2005. 

<p>If you want to play another part (drum, keys, base), feel free to record it and send it back to me.

The effect is a dual phaser with delay. It's in the key of E min blues. But ofcourse you already had heard that.

<p> Greetings Art

<td bgcolor=yellow>Mysterious story telling.<br>

Many songs start getting created by playing chords on my gitar.<p>

So this one too.<br>

Later the words are added and more chords follow.<br>

And I need the words to remember the rhytm and melody.<br>

And so after a while when the song is finished, you ask yourself:<br>

What's this song about?<br>

And this QuaakQuaak song is about a frog,<br>

dreaming of being kissed,<br>

just like in the old fairy tale.
