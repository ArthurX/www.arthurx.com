Here, you're looking through the glass window of a real old Dutch house.<br>
The mirroring shows the location at a canal (gracht) in the center of Delft.<br>
The wooden frame of the window is colored in a typical Dutch green.<br>

<p>They wanted a portrait of Bayes, because they use his maths alot.<br>
Just like google and all statistics freaks.

He's dead for such a long time now.
<br>They even don't have photographs of the famous geek.
<p>
His most important work was published posthumusly in 1763.

He was also a clergyman.
<p>Someone complained about the green in the painting,
<br>But how can you avoid green in a clergyman?
<p>Bimbo: Yellow,<br>King: Yellow, (cause he uses the services of the former)<br>Clergyman: Purple and Green.
<br>(Sadly, sadly: No Bimbo's for Clergymen and Scientists.)
<br>(At least officially, so it's sorry for all of you.)

 <P>
A close scrutiny of the procedings of the artist.
<br>(Everybody wants explanations.
<br> It's an art in itself.)

Nothing can start without blue.
<br>...If God created the God Earth and God Sun.
<br>.....He must have glued them in blue of the Holy Sky.
<p> And you know,
<br> Blue is quite sticky,
<br>Especially if it's wet.
