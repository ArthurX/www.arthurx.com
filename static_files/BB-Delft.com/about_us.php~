<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
Elizabeth will be your host.
Like in most places she is the real big boss.

<p>

Arthur is an artist and has decorated the rooms and the bathroom. 
You can visit the art website here: <a href="http=://www.arthurx.org">www.arthurx.org</a>,
but it's a bit chaotic. It also contains more about Elizabeth.

If we're both away our son, Sam, will be your host. He is a student in Computer Sciences and not a nerd.
