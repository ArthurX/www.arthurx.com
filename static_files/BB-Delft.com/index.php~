<h1>Bed and Breakfast Delft Elizabeth</h1>
<p>
Welcome to our b&b. <br/>
It's an Art B&B. <br/>
In all rooms there is art of the Dutch artist ArthurX.
<p>
It is located near the old city center with canals.<br/>
A walking distance of about 2 minutes.<br/>
A windmill is close by and it still works. <br/>
You can climb his internals and see the wooden toothwheels rolling over each other.</p>

If you come by train, we can come and pick you up.<br/>
About a 8 minute walk, partly along a canal.
