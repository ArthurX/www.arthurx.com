<p><b> Tachales Berlin Squat Art HeadQuarters</b>
<p>ArthurX playing paino in Tachales.
<br>Simon Burgel exhibited there and had a lot of friends visiting him.
<br>One of the evenings I saw two hands playing the piano next to me
<br>And I knew for shure that were not the hands of his friends,
<br> Because the hands came out of a too slick suit.
<p>
 After playing for some minutes I took a look at his face.
<br> It was a Croatian Cellist, who worked in Frankfurt.
<br>OK, we have no photo of the jam session.
<br>A real pity.

<p><h1><br><br>Brandenburger Tor<br></h1>
<img src="Berlin/Branden_Ghost_Sculpture_Close_720.jpg">

<p><b>Brandenburger Tor</b>
<p> Can you ommit that from a visit to Berlin?
<br> It's a part of history.
<br> I know it best from the films and documantaries,
<br> Showing parades for Hitler.
<p> When I am there, I remember those gloomy pictures
<br> And I asked myself can I paint this <br>
without making reference to that sad period in history?

<p>So I thought I needed to draw the ghosts of the victims.
<br> There are many victims: Jews, Russians, Poles, 
<br>Philosophers, Poets, Women, Baby's, Children <br>
And Yes, even the Germans were victims.

<p> A painting is not about how it could happen 
<br>or if it could happen again.
<br> A painting is about emotions and feelings.

<p> And I'm quite happy to see that the ghosts are not
that angry at all.
<br> I mean it would be the most horrible thing to be a victim
<br> and even have to be angry in the later life.
<p> But it is a sad, sad story.

<p><b>Schloss CharlottenBurg</b>
<p>This statue stands atop of the schloss.
<br>With the naked eye the statue is not good visible.
<br> But here on the photo you see clearly that it's not good sculpture.
<br> It's the body and face of young boy.
<br> They have cut off his penis and replaced that by two breasts.
<br> It is a transsexual operation avant la lettre.
<p> But statue is high enough so that no king ever complained.
<br><br><br>

<img src="Berlin/Charlot_Art_BlackBlue_720.jpg">

<p><b>Schloss CharlottenBurg in the making</b>
<p> The statues that ring the facade
<br> are a bit increased in size,
<br> so that it starts to look like a party on the roof.
<br><br><br>

<img src="Berlin/Charlot_Art_Kwast_clean_720.jpg">

<p><b>Schloss CharlottenBurg Garden</b>
<p> The garden was of real strict design.
<br>But the real design was only visible on Google Maps
<br> There were a kind of drawings with black and white pebbles.
<br><br><br>

<P> At home I added the grass green and old pink colors.
<br>I had forgotten them.
<p>We stayed with an old young landlady.

<p>This is Ingo, 
<br> He stayed in the room next to us and worked for the stock exchange.
<p> He almost wanted to buy the painting
<br>but he rather kept shares of Ford Motor Company.
<br>I tried to convince him that it is just a cyclical stock.
<p> He went by bus to bring the painting,
<br>so we could bike.
<br>Bikes are nice but not for carrying paintings.

<p> OK, we parked the bike against the trash can.
<br>It looks solid, it is solid, it sounds solid.
<br>Cast iron.
<p> And it was morning,
<br> so the local park gardner started his round 
<br>emptying all those oversized
garbage bins.

<P><h1><br><br>Peacock<br>Countess Herzogin <br>Röttenbörgh von Klein.<br></h1>
<img src="Berlin/Ruth_Art_Looking_gesneden_720.jpg">

<p>This is the beginning of the painting.
<br> I wanted to work out a sketch of some time ago.
<p> But it turned out to be another beast.
<br> After some time I gathered it looked more like our landlady.
<p> Later I was sure: 
<br>This was Countess Herzogin Röttenbörgh von Klein.
<br>She had a pride that would make every Peacock shiver away in shame.
<br>And even the amount of lipstick.
<p>Acutally she was quite friendly.
<br>But the pretention she had to uphold
<br> turned her somehow into a nervous peacock
<br> with a small twitch at the corner of her lips.
<p>The most remarkable was that she went every day out for dinner.
<br> Round 4 o'clock she left the home,
<br>And my guess is that she spent all the time networking.
<br> A real commercial wonder.
<p> The other thing was that every room had at least two mirrors.
<br> Not really amasing if you take the special care for appearances into account.
<p>But on these photo's you see the benefit.

<P><h1><br><br>Sphinx Sans Souci<br>Potsdam<br></h1>
<img src="Berlin/Sans_Souci_Sketch_720.jpg">
<p> <b>Sphinx Sans Souci</b>

<p>I know it is my own failure,
<br>and there are no excuses at all,
<br>but I could not find someone to make a portrait of. 
<p> We had been in cafe's for whole nights,
<br> Walked up and down all streets of Berlin.
<p>I could find no-one.
<br>There was an interesting pharmaciste,
<br>One evening a studente of Swiss came sitting next to me,
<br>I was too late to make a sketch,
<br>I was just talking and no thinking at all.
<p>And she was kissing her Italian boyfriend intensively,
<br>having only a weekend to spend,
<br>I didn't dare to intrude.
<br>Why am I so polite? and too shy?
<p>You know how it works normally.
<br>Elizabeth asks if I can make a sketch.
<br>Or better no asking at all.
<p>So here as a last resort 
<br>I turned to making a sketch
of dead stone cold creature.
<p>Thinking longer about this matter of intense tristesse,
<br>I think the problem lays in the lack of churches in Berlin.
<br>Usually on holiday one meets a church and enters,
<br>and lights two candles,
<br>One for the beautiful girls one has met and one for the girls one will meet.
<p>And as there are no churches in Berlin,
<br>No candles were lid
<br>And there was no divine providence
<p>Maybe next time in Berlin
<br>I will go to the most repulsive church
<br>and just light the two candles.
<br><br><br>

<p>You see the dark beautiful strong clouds?
<p>Summer can be great.
<p>But why did I carry the whole day two virgin canvasses,
<br>The whole day being afraid, they would be smurred with mud?
<br><br><br>
<img src="Berlin/SansSouci_Beeld_Art_Tourist_720.jpg">

<p>Right before sketching the sphinx,
<br>She walked in front,
<br>It was the last change,
<br>But see, 
<br>she only had eyes for the tourist guide in her hands.
<p>Looking to this photograph,
<br>I remember the moment,
<br>It was just starting to rain,
<br>I moved to the wide umbrella of a platane,
<br>The lane was lined,
<br>She walked fast away.
<br>No running after her to ask for a sketch,
<br>Just stick to the stonen sphinx.

<P><h1><br><br>Neue Synagogue<br></h1>
<img src="Berlin/Syna_Art_Black_Blue_720.jpg">

<p>One of the most remarkable buildings in Berlin is the synagogue.
<br>It is visible from many parts in the center.
<br>So we had seen it shine
<br>with it's oinion shaped dome
<br>Long before we arrived there.
<p>It is at the same street as the Tachales.
<br><br><br>



<img src="Berlin/Syna_Art_Mirror_Rose_720.jpg">
<p>I also added the ghosts to the synagogue.
<br>Where would you be waiting,
<br> if you had a lot of time?
<p>Hanging over the shoulder of the dome,
<br>Looking into the street,
<br>Where the hookers wait to lure their prey.
<p>Action, Action, Action.

<p>Here you see the black lines.

<br>It later disappears, behind the colors of the ghosts.
