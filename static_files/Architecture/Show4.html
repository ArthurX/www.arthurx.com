<h1><font size=8>Location</font></h1>
<font size=5>
Somewhere in close proximity of public transport
stands a 250 meter high rising office with a 
unmistakable clear name: "Tulips from Holland".<br>
Nobody won't forget where you're housed.

<h1><font size=8>Shape</font></h1>
<font size=5>
<p> 
The mainshape are three tulips, one red, one yellow and one purple.
The stems that lead upward to the flowerleaves are blue and white blocked in
in a hourglass patern. A patern which originates from the dutch farmers,
who used that motif for their wooden window shutters.<br>
The stems house the officespace. 


<h1><font size=8>Atria</font></h1>
<font size=5>


<p>
In the open space between the stems atriums 
are hung which span ten stories and hence have  height of 30 meters and an
 open window of 20 meters wide.<br>
The Atria form a kind of public squares glasscovered and decorated with
a botanic garden and fountain. A restaurant and cafe could be housed there too.
<p>
Each atrium should have a different theme like dessertsnake, crocodilemarsh, sharkbay.
<br><p>
The elevators are connected to two columns, each at a third of the atriumwindow.
Free hanging three meter wide alleys left and right lead to the officefloors.
 

 
<br><br>
<h1><font size=8>A Steel Frame</font></h1>
<font size=5>

<p>
The stems are made up of a outside steelframe, which carries the
loads, the officefloors, which are hung in the middle 
and a colored glass facade, which
covers the building.       








<br><br>
<h1><font size=8>Entrance</font></h1>
<font size=5>
The entrance to the building is through a  high  gate.
It opens to the lowest atrium. Rollstairs feed the stream of people
to five different floors from which six five-floor-high elevators
heave them up into the higher floors, like a train in stops of five floors.<br>
Underneath the building and the atrium is a parking.
Daylight enters the parking through the fountains glass bottom.

<br><br>
<h1><font size=8>Levels of Luxery and Ecology</font></h1>
<font size=5>
A double facade which leaves the possibility for semi-natural and individual
ventilation (after the Eco
Tower of Commerce Bank in Frankfurt). 
A decorated ceramicfloor with changing designs and
of course the hanging gardens in the atrium.


<br><br>
<h1><font size=8>Decorations</font></h1>
<font size=5>
Besides the raw outlines of the building as in this photo's
the actual facades of the towers and walls 
will be individually designed and modified.



<br><br>
<h1><font size=8>Philosophy</font></h1>
<font size=5>
What makes a building durable? <br>
What makes a building unique?
<P>
Well, all old buildings in towns, which still draw crowds,
were once build for rich people, that wanted to show off how well they were doing.
And to show off their increadible richness 
they didn't order the cheapest building with the least decorations.
<p>
No, they ordered lavish decorations and refined shapes.
No cost nor effort was saved to make something remarkable.
Every square millimeter of the outer and inner surface was used to express
their state in the society or their view.
<p>
And so if you look back and ask whether it was durable,
you can answer: Yes, the art and decorations made it so.
<p>
Most modern day achitecture is a waste of space and money,
because a lack of effort in the design and decorations 
simply doesn't produce the added value to stand the tooth of time.
