<H1>Big Bright Brains</h1>
<pre>
Big Bright Brains,
       Hot Long Legs.
She is walking 
        through the City*,
       And it ain’t the same.

And she is coming,
        and she is coming,
And she is coming,
        So closely by.

And she is coming,
        and she is coming,
She bends forwards
       and lifts her legs.

And she is coming,
        and she is coming,
She reaches out,
       stretches her shirt.

Rolling the pavement,
        As she goes.
Counting the clerkheads,
        As she goes.
Flying the chicken,
        As she goes.
Catching the butterflies,
        As she goes.
Playing the slideflute,
        As she goes.
Scetching the naked scene,
        As she goes.
Sucking the dewdrops,
        As she goes.
Making the clouds rain,
        As she goes.

And she is coming,
        and she is coming,
She put on high heels
      And she went straight on.


She looked left,
      She looked right;
             She danced,
                    Through the light.

Oh, oh,
What a business
         she takes.
Oh, oh,
What a business 
        she makes.
Under her arms
        like a big
        Suitcase.
Under her arms
        like a big
        Suitcase.

It’s almost like
        I feel the wind
        Breath her Lips.(*3)
