<H1>Thirteen</h1>
<pre> 

       
She shines at the playground,
         She tries it out. 
She is no woman,
         She ain't a kid.
             
She is thirteen 
         and she has it all.
             Legs,
                 Lips,
                      and the move    
                            of her hair.
                                 She is thirteen 
                                       and she has it all.
  
       
Her eyes follow me day and night,
Everywhere, she is  around and around.
             
She giggles with her friends
and slides into hide.

She is funny has the move and the air.
She has pinpointing eyes,
             
She talks to me loud and clear.
She laughs in my face and turns away.
                
She sits at the swing
and  I walk by with my kid.

Yes, thirteen, thirteen,           
and she will  go for her own.
Yes, for her own. 

Then she moves her lips again.
She is so pretty.
She is so funny.
She is so picky.
She is so tricky.
She is so easy.

But she wants to go,
          She wants to go.
                     She wants to go,
                            Her own way.
                                  Her own way.
                                         Her own way.

         Legs,
                 Lips,
                      and the move    
                            of her hair.
