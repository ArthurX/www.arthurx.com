<H1>Flower Picking</h1>
<pre>

Beginning of the summer
      and I was flower picking,
Crawling over the forest floor
      trying to find the best and some more,
Cleaning my pockets
      so they could hold the lot,
Closing in on an
                 empty lake.

She is a Quaak, quaak.
She is a Quaak, quaak.
Wow,
      I said a Wow, 
             I said a Wooaooow.

She is waiting on the princes
                               in a rotten pool.
She is dreaming of the funny boys
                               of a long away school.

And it’s cold.
              And it’s wet.
She is lonely sleeping
              on a slimey green bed.

She sticks out her tongue,
              that fastly unrolls.
She catches a bug,
              that randomly scrolls.
She is longing for
              some decent food,
She could eat 
              with a fork,
Most likely that would be
              an unfrozen dish 
                     with a lot of pork.
           closing in from behind.

You are what you eat.
             You do what you need.

She sees her former blond hair,
             Zimmering in the misty air.
She hears her mother calling,
             she should be a decent girl,
But she feels a male,
             closing in from behind.

She is a Quaak,quaak,
  She is a Quaak quaak,
       She is a Quaak, quaak
            Wooooooooooow


And then against all odds
      Comes a prince on a marble white horse
He reaches out,
      Takes her on his hand and heeaves her up
       Into the air.

It’s so romantical.
It’s  sensational.
It’s quite satisfactory.
Her mother told her to wait,
                                 And it pays!
Yes, the prince is coming into the stadium.
Watch the horse,  
It’s an indicator of your future wealth
Watch it,
Judge it,
Grap him, 
Take him of the horse.

He brings her to his lips, 
       and gives her the kiss of life.
            He breaks the ties and the spells 
                                                 of the past.


It’s all  captured in a moment of,
                                wild romance.
               For how long would it last,
                       For how long would it take,
                                Before he drives away.

And under that slimey green skin,
               what could there be,
                    what is it,
                          that that bright young clever Prince,
                               ever  could see.
I really don’t care,
         It’s an old story from 
                                 say-hear.

Actually its a fairytale
          Designed by mister
                      Walt Disney Himself.
