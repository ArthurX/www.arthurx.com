<H1>Hillary Rotten Clinton</h1>
<pre>
And you kept calling on the phone,
        And you kept knocking on the door,
                 And you kept begging for much more.
                            And you kept kicking on the floor,

                                     But I could not help you,
                            I could not serve you,
                   With my heart,
         For now and for ever.
    For now and for ever.
For now and for ever.

And I watched 
                  out of my
                          appartment
                                         door.
You had left my life now.
         You had gone so far now.
                  I won't see you,
                           I won't feel you,
                                         Any more.
                             For now and for ever.
                   For now and for ever.
       For now and for ever.

And I watched 
                  out of my
                          appartment
                                         door.

It is all turning red now,
        It's all turning dark and blue,
                 The stars are crossing the moon now.

It was a beautifull sommerset*,
        And I kept on screaming,
                And I kept on crying,
                       Till it all had gone away,
                                 Out of my heart,
                                         Out of my heart,
                                                 Out of my heart.
It was awild rupture,
We were torn apart, 
       And I kept on screaming,
                And I kept on crying,
                       Till it all had gone away,
                                 Out of my heart,
                                         Out of my heart,
                                                 Out of my heart.

I turned away, it was too hard,
It was a short finsh, without a real start,
        And I kept on screaming,
                And I kept on crying,
                       Till it all had gone away,
                                 Out of my heart,
                                         Out of my heart,
                                                 Out of my heart.

         
 
It is too late now,
        It is too late now,
                It is too late now,
                        To pass it over,
                                To let it fade away.
                                      Out of my heart,
                                            Out of my heart,
                                                    Out of my heart.
