<H1>Train Out</h1>
<pre>
It's a weekend with the train out ,
       It's a weekend all out, all out,
                                          Knock out.

And in the morning of the middlest night,
       It was already getting light.

                                 And the birds screamed 
                          And the waves broke near by,
                    It was all getting well.

She said it was my mothers fault,
       That I made sex like a wild assault.

                                And the birds screamed 
                          And the waves broke near by,
                    It was all getting well.

For me it worked fine,
        It only took six seconds time.

                              And the birds screamed 
                          And the waves broke near by,
                    It was all getting well.

I said maybe we can try it again,
        I will do more rubbing then.

                                And the birds screamed 
                          And the waves broke near by,
                    It was all getting well.

It should be done right at the first place,
        It should be part of my Quality Management.

                                And the birds screamed 
                          And the waves broke near by,
                    It was all getting well.

She said I was a lousy lover,
        A schoolboy in his very first days.

                                And the birds screamed 
                          And the waves broke near by,
                    It was all getting well.

I din't know about proper positions,
        I hadn't heard of her topology.

                                And the birds screamed 
                          And the waves broke near by,
                    It was all getting well.

My hands were active like an empty fly,
        My lips sucked like a ripe apple pie.

                                And the birds screamed 
                          And the waves broke near by,
                    It was all getting well.

I had hurt her soft peach cheek skin,
         With my upper bite wing,
                 With my upper bite wing.

                                And the birds screamed 
                          And the waves broke near by,
                    It was all getting well.

I should have given a nine month warranty,
        For perfect satisfaction,
                 For perfect satisfaction.

Just take away,
        Just take away,
                Just take the train fast away.

Just take away,
        Just take away,
                Just take the train fast away.

No more spin control,
        No more aftertalk analysis.

No more spin control,
No more aftertalk analysis.

No more daddy’s-in-law,
To say goodbye to.
No more faces to loose.

Bye , bye,
Leave it behind,
It’s a lost case.

No more wins,
You’re just a looser,
Take it for granted.

Take the train out of town,
Go fro the celibate.,
It’s a choice for quality.

Just take away,
        Just take away,
                Just take the train fast away.
