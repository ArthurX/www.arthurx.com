<H1><br>Icy Broke</h1>
<pre>
Running away on an icy broke.
Hunting an eagle on a rocky cliff.
Finding a spring at the mountainfeet.
      Clear water at your mouth,
Kissing a girl under her torn shirt.
 
Rubbing her lips with an iron belt.
   It’s a rusty old wreck.
Riding the river on a swollen trunk.
   Putting on your nice shoes.
Sewing together the parts I lost.
Tapping the snow with my barren feet.
   Leaving my marks behind.

Drawing a line in the airy sky.
Gutting out the meals I ate.
Making attempts at a shadow wall.
Asking the birds how to fly.

Sniffing a rose for pure perfume.
Zipping a girl out of her narrow fit.
   Making it look like a devil snit.
Following an ant into the subway tube.
Sucking the sun with my eyes wide close.

Bending a shovel around a hollow tree
Making a nice smile.
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
Hi, hi, ,hi, hi, hi, hi, hiii.
Hello, hello, hello.  

Clear water at your mouth,
Dripping of the hills,
Into the subshine valleys,
Of God’s Golden State.

Bare Naked Women all around,
Teasing the tip of my tongue.
Ringling, ringling, ringling bell.
Is Death calling?
I say Hi!
Flesh, flesh, flesh, flesh,
Give me more flesh.
Hi, hi,hi,hi,hi,hi,hi.

It are rusty old wrecks,
parked along side a shady road, 
old as the night,
waiting for a final chance.

Tickling, tickling,tickling all odd spots. 
Fundling, fundling, fundling all odd funds.
Man-Machine, 
a functional body, 
body functions, body lotions. 

Sweat, sweat, sweat, 
Sweet smell of sweat.
Transpiration cocktails,
Mixtures of flavor,
La Grande Odeur.

Love Peace, Flesh,
Love, Peace, Fish.
