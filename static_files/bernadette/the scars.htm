By Bernadette Giacomazzo, NYC.<p>
There's something about the Scars that I, as a reviewer, tend to 
  find incredibly endearing. It's not the fact that they're from Holland -- 
  though you can imagine my surprise when I, a Europhilic New York chick, got 
  the email from the Scars' ever-so-nice promoter, Elizabeth -- nor is it the 
  fact that they're cute as buttons -- this isn't Ricky Martin's latest fanzine, 
  people! It's the fact that they're so <I>sonic</I>. 
  <P>Let me explain something about the times we live in: we're days -- I'm 
  talking <I>inches</I> -- from the new millenium, and the only thing that 
  slightly represents apocalyptic mayhem is the so-called "music" we're 
  listening to: pop-schlock is being produced <I>en masse</I> with 
  Backstreet-N'Suck-98 Degrees Centigrade or whatever the hell else is coming 
  next from the toilets of the Svengali du jour, rock's new face is the Rage 
  Against the Korn clone of the day, and the "punk" bands can only get as 
  original as their bodily functions and lusting after barely-legal groupies. 
  It's a wonder I haven't slit my wrists in the Jacuzzi afte making an "I'm SO 
  SORRY, MOOOM!" tape a la <I>Blair Witch</I> project. 
  <P>Still, my salvation is CD's like <I>Rude Moon</I>. This CD, if nothing 
  else, is full-scale assault on all six senses -- yes, you read right; this 
  sort of thing penetrates your psyche, too, and you don't see N'Suck doing that 
  for you, now, do you?! -- and is, amazingly, startlingly poetic. 
  <P>The first song, "Rude Moon," does nothing more than assault you and your 
  sub-woofers with full-scale bawling out of the lyrics. But so what? That's the 
  point. Skip to "Mother Queen" for the sonic poetry: "Please give me a glance 
  at your daughter/Just a moment and a single faint word." Wherefore art thou, 
  Arthur? Dost thou knowst how bittersweet thine lyrics be, enough to wheedle a 
  sexual favor out of a throng of disillusioned girls or three? 
  <P>The other song that really thrilled me was "Flower Picking", which reminded 
  me, in a way, of my own thirteen-year-old self, and all the stupidity and 
  naivete that came with it. Still, you can't help but jump back when you hear, 
  "She is a WOW!", and believe me, you're instantly convinced that, yes, she 
  really is indeed. 
  <P>The jury's still out on which direction this "new music for the new 
  millenium" will be going. For the moment, though, we need bands like the Scars 
  to kick the rest of these losers, at least musically, in their isometrically 
  toned asses.
