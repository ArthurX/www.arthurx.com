<!-- Text from the movie: It's Death, who chooses,      "You", And he points to the person                    next of you. You nod polite,       Thank God for the salvation. Horrified,        See him be dissected. He clungs to the doctors       for a fair chance,               finally he has accepted. Slowly the class is cleared,       place after place. No escape,       Just spare time.        Poorest      the slave           to no-one. Copyright 1999 Arthur. Death , who chooses In heaven         I will hold                   your hand, In Heaven         I will take                   you away,         I will care                   for you,                  Be. Friction waste,      Friction waste,           Friction waste. Heavens Hand. Death comes slowely,     It takes its time,         Certainly it comes by. Step after step,      Inch for inch,         Other options seem to arrive,             Fade away. Castles melt, clouds dissappear,      Trees grow, birds around my head,         Twinkling, Twinkling, Twinkling, goes the  goat,             Bee, bee, muscles relax. Polish your head, Polish your head,      No dick today, No dick today,         He takes a holiday,             Nothing to spend, Nothing to spend,                 No drop today,  No drop yesterday,                     It's equal, float away.  May I sleep under your bed,      A dark place to stay,                  a corner, a hole. Breath in, Breath out, Enjoy the view,      Watch the skies, It's turning purple,             The stars, Jupiter.                  Float away. Build. Construct. Erect.      Build. Construct. Erect.          Pride. Glory. God.              Pride. Glory. God.                  Pray for me.                     In heaven I will rest. Polish your  Head. A spy of         his mind,     That's an artist. If life is like a prison                    without escape, A painting is a message                    to prisoners after you. "Kill Roy was here". Thinking is     directed dreaming. Message. -->
