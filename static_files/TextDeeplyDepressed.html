<H1>Bottom of the Ocean</h1>
<pre> 
   

I am so deeply depressed                   
      I am so lonely now
             I am at the bottom of  the ocean
                      and I am still not dead.                                                                    
  
How far wil it go
       How long will it be
             before I give my last breath 

I guess it will be oceans 
                full of years       
deprived of anything but fatal fears.
  
How far wil it go
       How long will it be
             before I give my last breath 

It will be endless
           endless repeations of
                  endless repeations of
                          hollow days.

It will full those oceans with
              these endless years.

I will keep moving,
        till the very last edge                  
I will keep moving,
        even if my feet don't walk  again.
I will keep moving,
       till I am completely deaf.
I will keep moving,
        Even if my eyeballs drop out
I will keep moving,
        Till my last livercell excrements.
I will keep moving,
         Till the patchwork explodes.
 
I am so deeply depressed                   
      I am so lonely now
             I am at the bottom of  the ocean
                      and I am still not dead.

How far wil it go,
       How long will it be,
             before I give my last breath. 

Is this anything at all,
       Is this anything  that makes,
                   sense at all,
                             at all, at all, at all.

It will be endless
           endless repeations of
                  endless repeations of
                          hollow days.

It's just a point of  time
      and I am still not  dead.
             still not dead. 
                    not  dead.
