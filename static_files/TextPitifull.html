<H1>Pitifull</h1>
<pre>
           
She is alone,                 
what poor she  is.
She 'll stay alone,
Oh, so pitifull.
                
She can't realize,
how life goes  on.
She can't accept,
how people  are.

She can't make up,
the way they fly.
She can't figure out,
the road they take.
                
She feels betrayed,
and caresses  that,     
to keep it  closed,
till the very  end.
                           
She shouts at the  flowers,
that don't  grow,
at her silly commands.

She can't make up,
the way they fly.
She can't figure out,
the road they take.
 
She blames the  gardner,                 
for being a  spy,
to set the  flowers,
up against  her.

So she  lives,                     
in a beautiful  home,               
with a garden around,
but all alone.

She can't make up,
the way they fly.
She can't figure out,
the road they take.
 
So alone and pitifull.
She can't accept,
how life goes on.

She feels betrayed,
and keeps it closed.
Shouts at the flowers,
that dont grow.
 
She can't make up,
the way they fly.
She can't figure out,
the road they take.
 
So she lives,
in a beautifull home,
so pitifull 
and all alone.
