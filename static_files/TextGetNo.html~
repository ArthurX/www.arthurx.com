<H1>Can't Get No</h1>
<pre> 
And I can't get no,
      and I can't get no,
           no no no enough of it to
                                     look at you.

You have a much too long nose,
      That blows my brain.

And your eyes squint close by,
       For the focus I get.

And your curly hairs,
       Really gets me through the moon.

And your mile long nails,
       Pierce my flesh.

And your lipposomes ,
       Give such a wild apeal.
They pump me up,
       Every boring long night.

And your star perfume,
        Really drops my pants.

And your sensible ears,
        Really give me wings.

And your silicones,
        Taste so fresh.

And I keep on flying for you.
And I keep on running for you.
And I keep on burning for you.
And I keep on lying for you.
And I keep on snaking for you.
