<H1>Rude Tonight</h1>


<H1><br>Rude Tonight</h1>
<pre>

I cant be rude tonight,
   I cant be rude tonight,
      I cant be rude tonight,
   If I’m looking at you,
      If I’m looking at you,
                 At those eyes.
                 At these  moving lips.
.                At your dancing hips.
                 At these through pressing
                                                   Nips.

And I will please you the whole
                                    Long night,
           As much as I can,
                As much as I possibly can give.

And for the whole long night,
       And for the whole long night,
    Keeps on getting closer,
       Keeps on getting closer,
          Keeps on getting closer,
                     With every move I make.
                     With every breath I take.
                     With every itch I  scratch.

    Keep on rocking,
       Keep on rocking,
          Keep on rocking,
                     Till the bottom of the night.
                     Till the bottom of the night.
                     Till the bottom of the night.
    Keep on rocking,
       Keep on rocking,
          Keep on rocking.
