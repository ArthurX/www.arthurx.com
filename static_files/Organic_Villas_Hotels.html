At street level there are shops with a internal second floor,<br>

<h1>Hotel Reve Sautant</h1>

It´s a framework of large timber beams.<br>

Connected at the ends to form irregular triangles projecting both inwards and outwards.<br>

Each beam is decorated with geometric wood carvings<br>

and a sculpture on every sixth beam depicting wild animals like Dolphins, Tigers, Elephants and Women and Man and parts of those.<br>

The wall between the beams and the windows is colored stucco on isolating straw to make it all ecological.<br><p>

<h1>Villa Forêt Humane</h1>

As a commissioned lithograph directly drawn on the stone, it represents<br>

a two story villa build on a large arcaded cellar (carparking).<br>

The veranda, which surrounds it, has a great view all around.<br>

It's decorated with wild spires as well on the terrasses and balconies as at the roof.<br>

Some of the spires can function as tea-rooms or separete rooms for teenagers.<br>

The framework is of large timbers organized in triangular shapes.<br>

<p>

A possible location is in Narbonne, France,<br>

with a view from a hill-side location over the valley<br>

to the old cathedral and center.
