<H1>Waiting Far Too Long</h1>
<pre>

If you ever haven’t got her
                 out of your Brains,
                      out of your Brains,
                           out of your Brains.

I never ever got her
                 out of your Brains,
                     out of your Brains.

You have been waiting, 
         You have been waiting,
                               far too  long.
         You have been waiting,  
                               all of your life.
         You have been dreaming,
                               all the time.
         You have been going,
                               so wild insane.

If you wanna know,
         If you wanna call,
                If you wanna be back at all.

What would you know,
           What would you tell.
What woud you know, 
           What would you tell.

What would it make for a show,
           What would it make to go.

You have been waiting,
       You have been dreaming,
            You have been longing, 
                            For all the time.

To see her back again,
               Back in your brains,
                  Back in your limbs,
                     Back in your soul,
                        Back in your chair,
                            Back in your womb.

You have been dreaming,
        You have been waiting,
              You have been longing,
                      For no more.

You have been calling,
        You have been worming,
              You have been longing.
 
If you ever know,
        what it ever would take.

If you ever see,
        what a word would,
                       Maaaaaaake,
                             Back.

If you got a liar,
         how would the world be seen.

What would it, 
         Don”t worry
What would it, 
         Don’t worry
What would it,
         Don’t worry
What would it, 
         Take.
