<H1>Vikings on the Rhine</h1>
<pre>
D(A barree 5)3*3/4   

We were vikings on the Rhine.
We were hunters,
We were rockers,
We were so young and so wild.

We were no backpack-holliday-tourists,
We were no scientists on the moon.

We were no dishwashing part-time daddies,
We were no doorpainting windowslaves.

We were no beachball muscleweenies,
We were no orgasmcounting fitnessmen.
