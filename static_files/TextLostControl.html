<H1>LostControl</h1>
<pre>
 

                              
I have lost all the control                                     
and I am wandering over the  street.
Just like a little  child,                                   
who is looking for his  mother.
                                 
But he has lost every track of her.   
He really seriously  doubts,
whether she ever  was there.
He even stops  thinking,
there ever was one for  him.
                              
He is in really panic now.               
He turns and  looks around.
He sees someone  coming,
with  a cap over her  hair.
                     
He tries to  call her,
but she turns away,
and when he reaches her,       
She looks back at him.                          
She opens the cap off her hair,           
and it's a  skull.                     
with no eyes at all.
It's a cold bold looking skull.
with no eyes at all.
                    
And it hunts him
hunts him to far away.
And he runs, runs, runs,
runs as  far as he can,
till he falls in a  hole,
just like a  trap,
with bars around.
      
So I have lost control,                                    
and are walking over the  street,          
still looking for some  warmth,
and a  little console
of you.
