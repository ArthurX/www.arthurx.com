<H1><br>DoctorFish</h1>
<pre>
Winding up.
          Winding down.
Through the little alleys, 
          Of my brains.
Through the little alleys,
          Of my brains.

She makes me 
         keep on trying,
     She makes me 
           keep on trying,
                 every black day, 
                       again, again. 

Turning me up,
       Turning me up,
             and I don’t know why ....

She makes me 
              wish to cry.
She makes me think
              I could  fly.

Turning me up, 
      Turning me up,
           and I
                don’t know why.

She makes me feel so
                       crampled, 
            Like I have eaten mingled glass.
She makes me feel so
                        nervous,
            Like I have sand on my ass.
 
It’s a
     goddamned story,
          and I
                don’t know why,
              and I 
                    don’t know why. 
    
Turning me up, 
      Turning me up,
           and I
                don’t know why.

Turning like an ant,
         on a fruitcake,
      Apple, Cherry, Blue.

       Flying like a flea, 
                  on a seagull,
               Apple, Cherry, Blue.

               Swimming like a snake,
                      in a sharkmouth,
                    Apple ,Cherry, Blue.

Sucking like a,
                    Doctor Fish,.
          Sucking like a,  
                       Doctor Fish,.  
     Every girl I can
                       Kiss,.
               Every girl I can
                                  Kiss.
