<H1><br>Hill de Mounta Vista</h1>
<pre>

He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista,
         He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista,
                   He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista.

Crawling through the jungle,
        Over the pampa grass.
Snake in his left hand,
        Knife between his lips.
Crossing the marshlands,
        in a dingyboat.

He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista,
         He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista,
                   He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista.

Hunting the spiders,
        Climbing in a tree.
Floating the swamps,
        Hanging in the border.
Dining a beatle,
        Lunching of the ants.

He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista,
         He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista,
                   He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista.


And the bombs were raining down,
        And the bombs were raining down,
                And the bombs were raining down,
                       And the bombs were raining down.

A crying child on his arm,
         Saved a woman on his back.
A crying child on his arm,
         Saved a woman on his back.
Dug a grave for a fallen friend.
        Fell in love with a local bitch,
Dug a grave for a fallen friend.
        Fell in love with a local bitch,

And the bombs were raining down,
        And the bombs were raining down,
                And the bombs were raining down,
                       And the bombs were raining down.

He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista,
         He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista,
                   He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista.

Air attack now,
         Shelly all around.
Landing in the morning,
         Boobytrap in his pants.
Ticking in his heart,
         Ticking in his pants.

He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista,
         He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista,
                   He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista.


And the bombs were raining down,
        And the bombs were raining down,
                And the bombs were raining down,
                       And the bombs were raining down.

A crying child on his arm,
         Saved a woman on his back.
A crying child on his arm,
         Saved a woman on his back.
Dug a grave for a fallen friend.
        Fell in love with a local bitch,
Dug a grave for a fallen friend.
        Fell in love with a local bitch,

And the bombs were raining down,
        And the bombs were raining down,
                And the bombs were raining down,
                       And the bombs were raining down.

He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista,
         He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista,
                   He kept on looking for hill de Mounta Vista.

Wandering through the graveyards,
         Talking to his friends.
Kissing their crosses,
         Smelling their soil.
Flipping the houses,
         Visiting all places.

And the bombs were raining down,
        And the bombs were raining down,
                And the bombs were raining down,
                       And the bombs were raining down.
