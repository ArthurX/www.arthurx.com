<H1><br>Mother Queen</h1>
<pre>
I lately overheard a fairytale
          of a faraway country.
It sucked on about a MotherQueen
          in a pretty big castle.
And in her hands she held a
          mirror of the future.
And every line she could 
          read, write or gum.

So It was a fairly important
           Lady there.
Every single person laid 
           in her hands.
I was a fairly bold boy 
           then:
I knocked a million times 
           I  knocked a million times
                   I knocked a million times
                            On her door.

She opened the door with a 
           wide open smile.
She asked me kindly what it was 
           that I wanted.

Did I want to peek in her mirror 
          for five dollarcent.
Or did I want to change a simple line
          in her textbook.

I knocked a million times
       I knocked a million times
                on her door.

I had been windowshopping 
         For a bright future:
Every prospect I had read.
      Every prospect I had read.
            Every prospect I had read.

Fainted away,
       Fainted away,
               Fainted away,
                      Became so blank.

Please, give me a glance 
          At your daughter.
Just a moment and a
          Single faint word.

She moved her hands like a 
           Wild machine.
She dragged on like a 
            real old Queen,
Invented a mount of excuses,
           I should purely fulfil,
                     No living Man,
                           Ever 
                                Would 
                                      Survive.

Please, give me wings.
          Please, give me wings,
                   Please, give me wings.
And let us fly away,
       Let us fly away,
          Let us fly,
            Let us fly,
              Let us fly away.

It would suck dragons,
         Out of their bloodfilled 
                        Holes.

Mix Dwarves into 
          Goldfine Wine.
Let a Thousand snakes
          Fly out of my heads.

Please give me a glance 
          at your Daughter,
               Just a moment
                   and a single faint
                              word.
