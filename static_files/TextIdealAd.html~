<H1>Ideal Ad</h1>
<pre>
You wanna turn me. (3x)
Into an ideal silly ad.
You wanna turn me. (3x)
Into an ideal silly ad.

It would be a life tinned like food in a can.
It would be the fruit without the jam.

You wanna turn me. (3x)
Into an ideal silly ad.

With consumer powerhouse power.
With the big money to spend.
A life which would make you proud.
A life that would feel you big and make you cry and shout.

It would be a life tinned like food in a can.
It would be the fruit without the jam.
You wanna turn me,
Into an ideal silly ad.
