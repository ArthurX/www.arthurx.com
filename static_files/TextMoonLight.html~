<H1>MoonLight</h1>
<pre> 
 When I kept on walking
                           Through the moonlight,
                       Longing
                            for the sense of your arm,
                       The words,
                             you wisper without harm.
                  
It is naked.
           It is skin between te scars,
                      When I roll towards the stars.
 
When I kept on walking
                           Through the moonlight,
                       Laurelled
                            with the silvershiny leaves,
                       Covered 
                            with a diamond flint of haze.
It is naked.
           It is skin between the scars,
                      When I roll towards the stars.

The rumours filling my golden horn.

Remembring the words
                    those under your cross.
The grass keeps growing 
                    over the rocks.
 
It is naked, 
       It is insane,
             It are the words,
                 that make the pain.

The insects turning your
                   inside out.
The blossomleaves 
                   flattering your stones.
    
It is naked, 
       It is insane,
             It are the words,
                 that make the pain.

The moments I searched
               under your shirt.
The moments in hide
               under your hair.
The moments in cover
               in your womb.

When I kept on walking
                           Through the moonlight,
                       Longing
                            for the sense of your arm,
                       The words,
                             you wisper without harm.
 
It is naked, 
       It is insane,
             It are the words,
                 that make the pain.
